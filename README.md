This repository documents my understanding of core data science fundamentals. It includes hands-on notebooks on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, visualization, and basic machine learning workflows. The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in how data science problems are approached step by step using Python and common data science libraries.
